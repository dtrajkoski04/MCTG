## Project-definition

The Monster Trading Card Game (MCTG) is a REST-based server application built using Java or C# to enable users to participate in a magical card game. Players can trade, manage, and battle with unique monster and spell cards. The project focuses exclusively on server-side development to support a variety of front-end interfaces (e.g., web, console, or desktop applications).
